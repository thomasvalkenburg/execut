Rob studied Information Sciences and Business Informatics in Utrecht, although admittedly, he spent more effort on Sticky-related activities. After graduating in 2019, he worked in various data-related roles. Starting as a data analyst, he soon realized he wanted to learn more about the underlying infrastructure needed for data science and engineering. Since then, his most interesting work has been as a data engineer and data platform engineer.

Nowadays, he works as a developer advocate for Y42 - a startup building a turnkey data orchestration platform. He loves that this role combines deep technical work with a more people-focused role. His favorite thing about work is meeting other people, learning from them, and sharing the stuff he has learned himself.
