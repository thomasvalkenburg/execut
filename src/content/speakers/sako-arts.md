Sako Arts is the CTO and Founder of FruitPunch AI, the global AI for Good community. As an AI specialist himself, he experienced firsthand that classical education does not prepare you to apply AI in the real world. Therefore, he founded FruitPunch to crowd-source engineers worldwide to apply AI for sustainable causes while being educated with real challenge-based learning. This way we can both develop AI to reach the Sustainable Development Goals and educate Engineers in state-of-the-art AI. Let's do some AI for Good together!
