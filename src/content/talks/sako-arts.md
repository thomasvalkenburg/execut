In this presentation you will see how you can hone your AI skills while applying them for Good! Sako will be explaining how their global community solves AI for Good Challenges while training people in the real-world application of state-of-the-art AI. He will do this by providing a tech deep-dive into the cutest challenge yet, AI for Seals. We will be delving into how a team of 50 AI engineers built an application in 10 weeks time that is not only able to recognize seals in pictures but also identify individuals to be able to track the population over a long time period. Let's apply some AI for Good together!
