In 3D games we see many types of user interfaces. In this session you will learn what they are, and how to best select which type of interface should be presented to our players depending on the player's level immersion while playing your game. You will see a case study covering a fictional abstract game realised for this talk and how the UI is structured from the ground up while best respecting immersion in our game world and giving the game's core systems room to breathe.
